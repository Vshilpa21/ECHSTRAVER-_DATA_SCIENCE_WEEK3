# TECHSTRAVER-_DATA_SCIENCE_WEEK3

Technologies:
o Python: Primary language for data analysis and visualization. 
o Pandas: For data manipulation tasks like cleaning, merging, and aggregating data. 
o NumPy: For numerical operations and efficient computation. 
o Matplotlib/Seaborn: For creating a variety of visualizations to help understand the data better.

Steps: 
1. Import Libraries and Load Data 
   o Start by importing the necessary Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. 
   o Load your dataset into a Pandas DataFrame to begin the analysis. 
2. Clean and Preprocess Data 
   o Handle any missing values in your dataset to avoid errors during analysis. 
   o Remove any duplicate entries to ensure the data's integrity. 
   o Convert data types if necessary (e.g., converting dates from strings to datetime objects). 
   o Extract useful information such as month from date columns or city from address columns. 
3. Conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 
   o Use descriptive statistics to get an overview of your data. 
   o Create visualizations to understand the distributions, patterns, and relationships within the data. 
   o Identify any correlations or trends that might be significant for your analysis. 
4. Draw Conclusions and Insights 
   o Answer the key business questions with insights derived from your EDA. 
   o Provide actionable recommendations based on your findings.
